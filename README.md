# Salicyl_Sales_Dashboard

A Big Data Analyst needs to understand the sales data of each brand within a company. 
The focus we aim for is to create a dashboard from the sales data of the Salicyl brand from Kimia Farma within one year, using the provided raw data. 
We need to comprehend the information in each field and column, then combine these fields into a base table for the marketing department. 
This base table will be utilized as the data source for visualization, and the results will be presented using the Google Looker Studio tool.
